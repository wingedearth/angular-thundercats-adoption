#Thundercats Adoption Service

#####Good evening. Welcome to the Thundercats Adoption Service.
I built this application to practice using AngularJS and a data service.

The application includes a number of poor, unloved Thundercats at
the animal shelter. You, the user, are Mumm-Ra, the kindly cat-lover
who is considering adopting a Thundercat. When you adopt a
Thundercat, the cat will be moved from the animal shelter to Mumm-Ra's
list of adopted Thundercats. But cats can be needy and a pain in butt,
so you have the option of euthanizing any of your Thundercats. And
as for euthanizing unadopted Thundercats, the Animal Shelter is always 
happy to serve up a dose of murder.
