#Build an Angular App from Scratch!

#####Good afternoon! Today you're going to take some time to go off on your own and complete a very important quest. A quest to SAVE SOME KITTIES!
<br>

####Learning Objectives
* Practice some of your newly aquired AngularJS skills!
* Be able to build a small AngularJS app ***on your own***
* Save some **kitties**! 

```
				   /\     /\
				  {  `---'  }    (Save me, please!)
				  {  O   O  }      .
				~~|~   V   ~|~~	  .

				      (  /
				       MM
```

####Your Quest...
* Save some kitties by building a Kitties Adoption app in Angular
* Rely on your newly aquired Angular skills (and other skills you've aquired at WDI) to build out this app and fullfill your quest
* Refer to the completed Kitties Adoption app projected on the screen and use it as your guide
* Do a ```git pull``` from our [class repository](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_6) to grab the [starter app](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_6/tree/master/work/w10/d02/instructor/angular-app-from-scratch) we have provided for you
* This is a solo lab, so you are to work individually. However, you may communicate with your fellow classmates if you are extrordinarily ***stuck*** and need a lifeline!
* Create a repository for your app: ```git add```, ```git commit```, and ```git push``` while you're working
* When you have finished, submit your app to Meredith by sending her your repo link
* **Have fun and good luck!**

####Some Angular directives and parts you'll be implementing and relying on...
```
		ng-app
		ng-controller
		ng-model
		ng-repeat
		ng-src
		and... filters!
		
```


####Bonus Challenges
* Add new kitties who need to be adpoted to your app *from the browser*
* Have the ability to delete a kitty from the list
* Incorporate a Google font or other font of your choice into the app
* Get creative and remember, ***have fun*** :)
